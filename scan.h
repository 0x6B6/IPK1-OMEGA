 * @brief Assembles and sends TCP SYN/UDP packets by given protocol, then awaits a response and evaluates port state. 
 * 
 * Final step of the TCP SYN/UDP scanning process. At this stage every information needed is collected,
 * the function proceeds to scan the selected port(s) and analyze the response.
 * 
 * port_scan() creates a packet with aproppriate protocol (TCP or UDP) header, sends it to the destination address and awaits response.
 * If a response is received, then the data from the response packet is extracted and interpreted.
 * If no response is received, the packet is resent again. After a specified number of retries, if still no response, the port is marked as filtered | open.
 * 
 * Depending on the protocol, second socket file descriptor may be created to receive packet responses, since closed UDP ports send ICMP responses back.
